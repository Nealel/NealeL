### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you're looking for examples of my code, I recommend:

* [wordsmasher](https://github.com/Nealel/wordsmasher) is a hobby project from 2021. It's a Java Spring Boot webapp that uses Markov models to generate fantasy names for writers, roleplayers and worldbuilders
* [dr-quarantino](https://github.com/Nealel/dr-quarantino) is very, very simple, but probably my favourite thing I've ever built. It's a slackbot that asks conversation starter questions that my team's been using since the first week of lockdown.
* [PortraitPainter](https://github.com/Nealel/PortraitPainter) is my Master's thesis project from 2015. The code quality is very rough, and the machine learning algorithms it uses are massively outdated, but I still believe the concept is interesting.

Or to see some of what I've been reading and learning, check out [learning-notes](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/README.md)
